We need array detection- we should not be able to index a variable that's not an array

We need math in return statements.
    
Function checking
-> Parameters, return type, etc

In a top level if-else, the final label (I think the end label) isn't printed in the right place; it should go after the block

Module including- we need a way to not include duplicate modules

Octal type and literals

Array math for size- It doesn't seem to be working
